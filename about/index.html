	<h1>About Me:</h1>
	<p>I currently work at the JM Smucker Company as a Senior Data Analyst.  At Smucker I deliver analytics projects and capabilities to retail customers like WalMart, Target, and Kroger.  Most of my work falls into one of two categories: 1) interactive data visualization and 2) machine learning / data mining.</p>

	<p>Outside of analytics I enjoy running, watching NBA basketball, and playing Rocket League.  I live in Akron, Ohio with my partner Megan and our cat, Meeko.</p>
