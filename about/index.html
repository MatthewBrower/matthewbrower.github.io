		<ol>
			<li><p>Data Mining (with some machine learning tossed in) and </p></li>
			<li><p>Interactive Data Visualization.</p></li>

	</ol>
	<p>Outside of my professional career I enjoy running, watching NBA basketball, and playing Rocket League.  I live in Akron, Ohio with my partner Megan and our cat, Meeko.  I hold a Bachelor's degree in Marketing from Miami University in Oxford, OH.</p>
