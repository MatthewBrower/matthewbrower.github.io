	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I'm a Senior Data Analyst at Smucker's, where I work within the Sales &amp; Marketing functions.  I primarily build data 'products' and deliver custom analysis to retail customers like Wal-Mart.</p>

	 <p>Most of my projects at Smucker's fall into two categories: </p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Data Mining &amp; Machine Learning, and<p> </li>
			<li><p>Interactive Data Visualization</p></li>

	</ul>

	<p>My (in progress) <a href="/blog">blog</a> showcases some side projects that are reflective of the tools &amp; approaches I use at work.</p>

	<p>Outside of data analytics I enjoy running, watching basketball, and playing Rocket League.  I live in Akron, OH with my significant other, Megan.</p>
