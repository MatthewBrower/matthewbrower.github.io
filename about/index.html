	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I'm a Senior Data Analyst at Smucker's, where I work within the Sales &amp; Marketing functions.  I primarily build data 'products' and custom analysis that I deliver to retail customers like Wal-Mart.</p>

	<p>Most of my projects incorporate data mining techniques and interactive data visualizations.  My <a href="/blog">blog</a> (in progress) showcases some side projects that are reflective of the tools &amp; approaches I use.</p>

	<p>Outside of data analytics, I enjoy running, watching basketball, and playing Rocket League.  I live in Akron, OH with my significant other, Megan.</p>
