	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I am a Senior Data Analyst at Smucker's, where I work within the Sales &amp; Marketing groups.  I primarily build data 'products' and deliver custom analysis to retail customers like Wal-Mart.</p>

	 <p>Most of my work at Smucker's falls into one of two categories: </p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Data Mining &amp; Machine Learning and </li>
			<li>Interactive Data Visualization</p></li>

	</ul>

	<p>Outside of my professional career I enjoy running, watching NBA basketball, and playing Rocket League.  I live in Akron, OH with my partner, Megan.</p>
