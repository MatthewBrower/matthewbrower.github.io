	<h1>About Me</h1>
	I currently work at the JM Smucker Company as a Senior Data Analyst.  At Smucker I deliver analytics projects and capabilities to retail customers like WalMart, Target, and Kroger.  Most of my work falls into one of two categories: 
		<ol>
			<li>Data Mining (with some machine learning tossed in) and</li>
			<li>Interactive Data Visualization.</li>

	</ol>
	Outside of my professional career I enjoy running, watching NBA basketball, and playing Rocket League.  I live in Akron, Ohio with my partner Megan and our cat, Meeko.  I hold a Bachelor's degree in Marketing from Miami University in Oxford, OH.
